						<p><small>Amazon Glacier Select is a new way to query archived data in Amazon Glacier. Glacier Select allows queries to run directly on data stored in Amazon Glacier, retrieving only the data you need out of your archives to use for analytics. This allows you to reduce total cost of ownership while massively extending your data lake into cost-effective archive storage.</small></p>

You can also stream other time-encoded data like RADAR and LIDAR signals using Kinesis Video Streams.</small></p>
